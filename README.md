### About this Site

- Is this site awesome?  Hell no.
- Is this site a replacement?  Nope.  Some stuff made it, some didn't.
- Can you read and build on the wiki's?  Yes.  PR's welcome.

Please note this site was taken offline for security reasons, so handle the "original" folder in the [git repo](https://github.com/MichaelJCole/wiki.unrealengine.com) appropriately.

### How this data was collected

The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) has a wayback machine:

```
https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wiki.unrealengine.com/*
```

The [Wayback-machine-downloader](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader) has a Docker image:

```
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/websites:/websites hartator/wayback-machine-downloader https://wiki.unrealengine.com/ 
```

Some scripts and some [VuePress](https://snipcart.com/blog/choose-best-static-site-generator) and viola!

### How can I help?

PR's welcome.  I wanted to setup Git for my project and wanted to read the Git articles (git is the wrong tool.  Subversion is my new jam).  I'm not planning to grow or maintain the site, but will merge PR's.
